## Validation

### Html Validation

Html validation was done with [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/). All pages were tested by manually inputting the code into the validator.

### Python Validation

Python code was validated using [http://pep8online.com/](http://pep8online.com/).  I also used the GitPod workspace to check for errors as I coded.  I found this useful as there were less errors once I ran the code through the validator.

## Lighthouse Testing

All pages were checked on lighthouse.  Results were over 90% for performance and best practice and 100% on Accessability and SEO on both mobile and desktop.  On the first test performance was very poor.  This was fixed by applying height and width to an image.

## Manual Testing

To ensure that all elements of the website were working I carried out a detailed manual test and checked off the list as I went.
